# Investigating the Influence of Growth Arrest Mechanisms on Tumour Responses to Radiotherapy

This repository contains the MATLAB code used to generate the three virtual tumour populations studied in the pre-print of *"Investigating the Influence of Growth Arrest Mechanisms on Tumour Responses to Radiotherapy"* [1] and to numerically solve the ODE model for radiotherapy response proposed in [1]. All details for how to run the code, can be found in the MATLAB live script. For reproducibility purposes, we also include a spreadsheet that contains the parameter sets that define the three virtual cohorts.
